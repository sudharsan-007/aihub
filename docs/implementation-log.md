# Unified AI Platform: Implementation Log

## Overview

This document records the implementation of the Unified AI Platform on Railway, including the setup of all services, configuration, and troubleshooting steps taken.

## Initial Setup (April 2023)

### Project Configuration

1. Created a new Railway project "aihub" with ID `fc9bd1de-b0e3-4ca5-94d3-72cc7d1d9f1f`
2. Decided on a microservices architecture using Docker containers
3. Established environment variables for service configuration
4. Set up domains for all public-facing services

### Service Deployment

The following services were deployed as individual Docker containers on Railway:

| Service | Docker Image | Purpose | Status |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| LiteLLM Postgres | PostgreSQL (managed) | Database for LiteLLM | Active |
| LiteLLM | ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main | AI Model Proxy | Active |
| OpenWebUI | ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:latest | User Interface | Active |
| Tika | apache/tika:latest-full | Document Processing | Active |
| SearXNG | searxng/searxng | Web Search | Active |
| JupyterLab | jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest | Code Execution | Active |
| Redis | redis:alpine | Caching | Active |

## Service Configuration

### LiteLLM Configuration

1. Set up PostgreSQL connection using DATABASE_URL variable
2. Configured Redis connection with REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT
3. Generated secure LITELLM_MASTER_KEY
4. Added API provider keys (OpenRouter, EdenAI)
5. Set up TCP proxy for Redis access through internal network

### OpenWebUI Configuration

1. Configured connection to LiteLLM API
2. Set up document processing with Tika
3. Enabled web search with SearXNG
4. Connected to JupyterLab for code execution
5. Configured authentication settings

### Service Connectivity

All services were connected using Railway's internal network:

1. Internal services accessible via `.railway.internal` domains
2. External services accessible via generated Railway domains
3. TCP proxies established for database and cache access
4. Environment variables updated to ensure proper connections

## Troubleshooting

### SearXNG Redis Connection

SearXNG initially failed to connect to the Redis service. This was resolved by:

1. Setting the proper Redis environment variables (REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT)
2. Restarting the SearXNG service
3. Verifying successful connection through logs

### LiteLLM Database Connection

LiteLLM requires a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. The setup included:

1. Creating a PostgreSQL service with Railway's database template
2. Configuring LiteLLM to use the database with the DATABASE_URL environment variable
3. Setting STORE_MODEL_IN_DB to True
4. Verifying successful connection through logs

## Cleanup and Improvements

### Repository Cleanup

The following files were removed as they were no longer needed:

1. docker-compose.yml - Replaced by individual Railway services
2. railway.toml - Outdated configuration
3. railway.json - Outdated configuration
4. deploy-litellm.sh - Obsolete deployment script
5. Dockerfile - Redundant with prebuilt Docker images
6. services/ directory - Replaced by direct Docker image deployment

### Documentation Updates

1. Updated README.md with current deployment architecture
2. Revised railway-deployment-guide.md for the current approach
3. Updated unified-platform-architecture.md to reflect the Railway deployment
4. Updated openwebui-configuration.md with Railway-specific configuration
5. Created this implementation log to document the process

## Current Status

All services are successfully deployed and connected on Railway:

1. OpenWebUI provides the frontend interface
2. LiteLLM handles AI model access
3. Tika processes document uploads
4. SearXNG provides web search capabilities
5. JupyterLab enables code execution
6. Redis provides caching
7. PostgreSQL stores configuration and logs

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper monitoring and alerting
2. Configure regular database backups
3. Document user workflows and examples
4. Implement load testing and performance optimization
5. Create a centralized logging solution

## 2025-04-23: Configuration Fixes and Service Integration

### LiteLLM UI Authentication Fix

Fixed authentication issue with LiteLLM UI by correcting the malformed password environment variable:

- Found and fixed a syntax error in the `UI_PASSWORD` environment variable that had an opening quote but missing closing quote
- Updated to `UI_PASSWORD=root123pass` (without quotes)
- Credentials for accessing LiteLLM UI:
  - Username: `admin_sudu`
  - Password: `root123pass`

### JupyterLab Integration with OpenWebUI

Resolved authentication issues between OpenWebUI and JupyterLab:

- Identified that JupyterLab is using password-based authentication (not token-based)
- Updated OpenWebUI to use the same password as JupyterLab
- Added `JUPYTER_PASSWORD` environment variable to OpenWebUI matching the JupyterLab configuration

### SearXNG Web Search Configuration

Configured OpenWebUI to properly use SearXNG as the default search engine:

- Set `RAG_WEB_SEARCH_ENGINE=searxng` in OpenWebUI environment variables
- Verified the proper query URL format: `SEARXNG_QUERY_URL=https://searxng-production-4499.up.railway.app/search?q=<query>`

### Platform Security Review

Verified security configurations across all services:

- All services use proper authentication
- Environment variables for API keys and secrets are properly set
- Internal service communications use Railway's internal network
- External access points secured with appropriate authentication mechanisms

## Next Steps

- Set up proper monitoring for all services
- Configure backup procedures for PostgreSQL and Redis data
- Create comprehensive user documentation for the platform
- Implement automated testing for service integrations
- Review resource allocation and optimize as needed
