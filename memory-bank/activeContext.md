# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently working on developing a comprehensive Railway deployment guide for our Unified AI Platform. The guide document has been created and contains detailed instructions for setting up, configuring, and deploying the platform.

## Recent Changes

- Created the Railway deployment guide document with detailed architecture diagrams
- Added step-by-step deployment instructions
- Included troubleshooting guidance
- Added backup strategy documentation
- Created configuration file templates

## Next Steps

1. **Review Deployment Guide**
   - Ensure all steps are clear and accurate
   - Validate architecture diagrams
   - Check configuration examples

2. **Implement Additional Features**
   - Consider adding more model providers
   - Explore integration with additional tools
   - Develop monitoring capabilities

3. **Create Supplementary Materials**
   - User guide for platform operators
   - End-user documentation
   - Quick start guide

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test deployment process end-to-end
   - Validate all features are working
   - Document any issues encountered

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Decisions

1. **Deployment Platform**: Railway selected for its ease of use and container orchestration capabilities
2. **Documentation Approach**: Comprehensive guide with diagrams for better understanding
3. **Service Selection**: Core services chosen based on functionality and stability

### Open Questions

1. Should we add more document processing options beyond Tika?
2. Is the backup strategy sufficient for production use?
3. How should we handle scaling for higher usage?
4. What monitoring and alerting should be added?

### Technical Considerations

1. **Security**: Ensuring proper API key management and service authentication
2. **Reliability**: Implementing proper fallback strategies for model connections
3. **Performance**: Optimizing caching and network configurations
4. **Maintainability**: Setting up proper update procedures
