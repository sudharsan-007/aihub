# Progress

## What Works

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment guide created
- ✅ Architecture diagrams completed
- ✅ Configuration templates established
- ✅ Step-by-step deployment instructions documented

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` template with all required services
- ✅ `litellm/config.yaml` for model configuration
- ✅ `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- ✅ `railway.json` for Railway deployment
- ✅ `Dockerfile` for Railway environment

### Deployment Process
- ✅ GitHub repository setup instructions
- ✅ Railway project configuration steps
- ✅ Environment variable configuration process
- ✅ Domain setup instructions

### Testing Procedures
- ✅ Testing guidance for each major feature
- ✅ Troubleshooting guidance for common issues

## What's Left to Build

### Implementation
- ⬜ End-to-end deployment verification
- ⬜ Performance testing under various loads
- ⬜ Security audit of the configuration

### Additional Features
- ⬜ Monitoring and alerting setup
- ⬜ Advanced backup and restore procedures
- ⬜ High availability configuration
- ⬜ Multi-region deployment instructions

### Documentation
- ⬜ User guide for platform operators
- ⬜ End-user documentation
- ⬜ Quick start guide for new users
- ⬜ Development guide for extending functionality

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Deployment Guide | Complete | All sections finished |
| Architecture Definition | Complete | Diagrams and flow charts created |
| Configuration Templates | Complete | All necessary files templated |
| Testing Documentation | Partial | Basic testing covered, needs expansion |
| User Documentation | Not Started | Planned for next phase |
| Implementation Verification | Not Started | Needs actual deployment testing |

## Known Issues

1. **Backup Strategy Limitations**
   - Railway doesn't provide built-in backup solutions
   - Current GitHub Actions-based backup solution needs testing
   - Recovery process not fully documented

2. **External API Dependencies**
   - Solution depends on external APIs that may change
   - Cost management requires vigilant monitoring
   - Rate limits may affect performance under heavy load

3. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Many environment variables to configure correctly
   - Interdependencies between services require careful setup
   - Troubleshooting complex setups can be challenging

4. **Missing Monitoring**
   - No built-in monitoring solution yet
   - Health checks and alerts not implemented
   - Performance metrics not collected
